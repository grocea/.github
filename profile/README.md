## 📱 What is Grocea?

Grocea is a receipt-based meal planning application that solves the age-old question: **"What's for dinner?"** by using real data from your shopping history.

### The Problem
- Food waste from forgotten ingredients
- Overspending on groceries
- Difficulty planning meals with what you have
- Not knowing when staples will run out

### The Solution
- **Scan receipts** to automatically track purchases
- **Get recipe suggestions** based on current pantry inventory
- **Reduce food waste** with expiry tracking and smart recommendations
- **Forecast stock levels** to know when to restock staples
- **Track spending** with price-per-meal analytics

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- **📸 Receipt Scanning**: OCR-powered receipt scanning with automatic item normalisation
- **🍳 Smart Recipe Recommendations**: Personalised suggestions based on available ingredients, dietary restrictions, and cooking preferences
- **📦 Pantry Management**: Real-time inventory tracking with automatic stock updates
- **📊 Usage Forecasting**: Predict when staples will run out using time-series analysis
- **⏰ Expiry Tracking**: Get notifications for items approaching expiry dates
- **💰 Cost Analytics**: Track price-per-meal and identify spending patterns
- **✍️ Custom Recipes**: Create personal recipes with NLP-powered ingredient extraction

## 📝 Development Notes

Currently developing basic OCR functionality.

- Image preprocessing around 50% there
  - For cleaned receipts, the preprocessing will process too much, removing too many details, resulting in gibberish being read by EasyOCR
  - Need to finetune preprocessing steps

- OCR using EasyOCR
  - Somewhat accurate, issues with "." and "," and reading currency symbols when using existing model
  - May need to custom make a model for reading receipts

- Text processing
  - Able to detect dates, amounts, and total from read text, but depends on quality of read text from OCR

## 🤖 Machine Learning Components

Grocea leverages several ML/AI techniques:

1. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**
   - Receipt text extraction and parsing
   - Item normalisation across different retailers

2. **Recipe Recommendation System**
   - Collaborative filtering
   - Content-based filtering using ingredient matching
   - Weighted scoring algorithm considering user preferences

3. **Time-Series Forecasting**
   - ARIMA/LSTM models for stock prediction
   - Usage pattern analysis

4. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Recipe ingredient extraction
   - Text normalisation and entity recognition
   - Fuzzy matching for product names
